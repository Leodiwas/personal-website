## Styling
Everything will have to be built using components. Components should be placed under the `/components` directory and imported within `app.scss` file. 
- buttons.scss


## JavaScript
No external libraries are to be directly imported within the HTML using script tags. They should be imported within gulp and be preprocessed and concatenated into `app.js`.
Any custom scripts should be placed into `scripts.js` file.

## Src/Dist folder
- the `dist/` folder is automatically generated with the gulp build. The files under this folder are to be referenced in HTML
- the `src/` folder contains the raw scripts and styles. 



## Running Locally

- run `php -s localhost:8005`
